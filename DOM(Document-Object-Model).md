1. What is DOM?
sol: DOM stands for Document Object Model

                    Document
                       |
                    Root element(<html>)
                       |
    
    Element(<head>)                 Element(<body>)
           |                              |
    Element(<title>)                Element(<div>)
            |
    Element(Text)

    -> this is called DOM view.
    ->In the DOM view D-> is called your html
    ->O-> Object ->all html elements like head,body title called  object
    ->M-> Model->complete above DOM view structure is called Model

    Note-> everthing in DOM is called Object. i.e jS object.
