---------------------------------- what is programming language?
If we have to write a recipe for cooking food->then we can use different human languages like hindi,english,french,so..on.

Similarly to make system/laptop or machine to understand what we want to tell or if we are writing code for Recipe inside m/c for that we use programming language so that m/c can understand and execute accordingly.


-----------------------------------------

JS ->
1. Case Sensitive -> It matters means whether an identifier like variable is in uppercase or lowercase during interpretetion or compiling.

2. supported unicode lang also so we can declare german language.

3. Statement: if we are writing multiline statement then we should give semicolon(;)
               we should always close the statement with semicolon(;)
              e.g:  var x,y,z; //declare variable
                        x=5;y=6; //assign values
                        z=x+y;   //compute values          

4. Comments:    // single line comments

                /* Multi
                      line 
                       comments */ 

        Note: comments are ignored by compiler.


NOTE: JS is dynamically typed language.
